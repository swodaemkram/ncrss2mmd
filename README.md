Nextcloud to Mattermost Activity Monitor
I need a way to monitor my NextCloud server and know
when someone downloads something from it.

So when finished this will be a daemon that will live on the 
NextCloud server and monitor the RSS feed in question
and send this information to an incomming web-hook in
my Mattermost Server. That will show me who downloaded what
when in a mattermost channel.

This Daemon will be writen in c++ .
